# Portfolio

This is my portfolio website after switching to GitHub Pages. I initially made my portfolio full stack and hosted it on Heroku to show I can do it. However, with Heroku if it hasn't been visited in a half hour, it takes 30 seconds to load. I decided change it to GitHub Pages to get rid of this load time.
